    <p>
      Hello, I have a passion for coding, particularly in web development. Over
      seven years of learning and experimenting with it, I have created numerous
      projects but have not always prioritized maintaining or showcasing them.
      As a result, I have a collection of small projects scattered around. The
      ones featured in my portfolio are the best ones I have created recently,
      showcasing my current skills. However, there are many more and I am in the
      process of listing all of them here. The goal is to demonstrate my
      progress over the years. I plan to keep this list updated as I continue to
      develop new projects.
    </p>
